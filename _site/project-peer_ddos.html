										<p>In computer networks, data is transmitted as packets across
											optimally-determined paths. Traditional
											networks manage both packet forwarding and path determination within
											the
											same hardware device, such
											as routers and switches, relying on various independent protocols
											(ARP, STP,
											OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, etc.)
											to achieve different functions. This tight coupling hinders
											scalability and
											flexibility. Software-defined Networks (SDNs) address these
											limitations by
											decoupling the data plane
											(packet forwarding) from the control
											plane (path decision-making).

					<p>Figure 4 presents a typical SDN operation in a switch for an arriving packet. The
						controller
						installs in that switch a flow rule,
						which tells the switch what to do with that packet (based on extracted information). For
						example, if the packet arrived at port 2 from host h2, destined to host h1 (which is
						connected
						to the switch at port 3), a flow rule is installed to send it along that port. This rule
						has a
						lifetime, say 15 seconds. If within those 15 seconds a similar packet (same origin,
						destination)
						arrived,
						it is treated as per the active flow rule - the switch does not need to contact the
						controller
						anymore.
					</p>

					<p>Switches in an SDN uses Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) registers for fast
						lookups.
						However, TCAM entries are limited due to its high costs and power consumption, usually
						limited
						to around 8000. An attacker could exhaust this limit by sending spoofed packets, each
						with
						unique details, triggering the creation of more flow rules than available space,
						effectively
						stalling the switch.
					</p>

					<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2016.2602861" target="_blank">[1]</a> showed how the empty tables of nearby switches can offload incoming traffic of a
						targeted
						switch, assuming, of course, an average attacker and that only a single switch is being
						targeted. For this to effectively work, the network should be mesh topology; i.e., every
						switch
						is connected directly to another. This project operates on the same principle, but the
						implementation is my own.
					</p>

					<p>Firstly, we monitor the flow table of each switch. Two conditions should then be
						satisfied:
						<br />
						1 - that the number of flows has exceeded a pre-defined limit, <br />
						2 - that the rate of inbound packets has exceeded a pre-defined limit.
					</p>

					<p>Afterwards, we install a wildcard flow rule (i.e., for any new packet at all, do this ...) that
						directs traffic to a nearby peer switch
						with
						sufficient flow capacity should they too become inundated. The same is done for every
						switch.
						Default flow rules triggered like this have a natural lifetime. The number of switches
						in the
						network is directly proportional to
						how longer it can withhold an attack. Combined with the fact that each switch has a
						direct
						connection to every other, this method increases attack response times before the
						network can be
						stalled.
					</p>

					<p>This method seems very primitive, as it is a mere (though successful) proof-of-concept. An
						attacker with normal resources will be exhausted using existing network power.
						Defense systems can always refine it further. See the following graphs tracking the holding time
						(defined as the time it takes for any one switch to have reached the maximum flow capacity) in a
						network with and without the method.
