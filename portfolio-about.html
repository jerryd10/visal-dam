							<p>
								Greetings! I am a dedicated, high-achieving student at Deakin University, studying for a
								Bachelor's of Cybersecurity. My passions lie in Network Security,
								Digital Forensics, Threat Analysis, Cloud Security, Governance,
								and the bridging of Cybersecurity with Machine Learning and new technologies (SDN, IoT).
							</p>
							<p>
								My time at Deakin University has been devoted to two main things: academic excellence
								and meaningful community engagement. Deakin's School of Information Technology, where I
								am currently employed as an <a href="https://experts.deakin.edu.au/65474-visal-dam"
									target="_blank">Associate Teaching Fellow</a>↗, employs a task-/portfolio-centric
								model of assessment - rather than exams, our grades are determined by the practical
								tasks we choose to complete. In other words, if one wants an HD grade, they must do all
								Pass-, Credit-, Distinction-, and High Distinction-level tasks. I have consistently
								striven to achieve far greater than what is expected of students each trimester,
								resulting in my high WAM and experience with meaningful security projects.
							</p>
							<p>
								I really enjoy teaching and mentoring, which forms the basis of my service to the
								student community. I began exercising this passion in 2024 as a Maths (and later Writing)
								Mentor, providing academic support and guidance to other students. In 2025 I became an
								Associate Teaching Fellow within the School of Information Technology, teaching
								mathematics units. I plan to make use of this skill to aid organizations in training and
								nurturing in-house talent on Cybersecurity and IT matters.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of my studies, I like to play badminton. I also enjoy cooking, as what
								began as a way to save money at university soon turned into a genuine
								passion for experimenting with new recipes. I love discussing world history and culture
								- a natural outcome of my frequent reading and deep-dives into Wikipedia (look at the
								way this page is structured!).
