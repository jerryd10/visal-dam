									<h3>With A Mission</h3>

									<p>
										I am the head student volunteer for a biweekly food drive, operated by With A
										Mission, at Deakin Residential Services. We distribute free meals and grocery
										items to student residents. As the head volunteer, I oversee
										the collection, storage, display, and distribution of donated items, ensuring
										smooth operations throughout each event. I also coordinate with the organizers
										and fellow volunteers to manage logistics, maintain food safety standards, and
										create an inclusive, supportive environment for all participants. Together, our
										team caters to approximately <strong>80 to 120</strong> students every two
										weeks, helping to reduce
										food insecurity and foster a stronger residential community.

									<h2>Peer Mentoring</h2>

									<h3>Maths & Writing Mentor</h3>

									<p>
										As a Maths and (later on) Writing Mentor, I provide academic support and
										guidance to other students concerning mathematics and academic writing concerns,
										respectively. Having conducted over <strong>70+</strong> one-on-one sessions,
										this role has strengthened my ability to explain and break down complex concepts
										clearly, tailor learning approaches to individual needs, and foster students'
										confidence and independence in their studies. Through ongoing mentoring, I have
										developed strong interpersonal and communication skills while contributing to
										the overall academic success of the student community.

									</span>

									<h3>Deakin University Cybersecurity Association (DUCA)</h3>

									<p>
										As part of the DUCA committee, I played a key role in the coordination, setup,
										and logistics of on-campus events. I also primarily managed the club's support
										from
										<strong>RedBull Australia</strong>, overseeing the collection, storage,
										transfer, and
										distribution of complementary RedBull to our members during our events. This
										role strengthened my organizational and teamwork skills while ensuring that each
										event ran smoothly and maintained strong sponsor relationships.
									</p>
									<p>
										As part of our events, I have been a speaker for two important Cybersecurity
										talks: one focused on Cybersecurity certifications and career pathways, and
										another discussing the 2024 Australian Cyber Bill and its implications for
										professionals and students. These experiences allowed me to share insights,
										engage with peers on emerging cybersecurity issues, and contribute to raising
										awareness within the student community.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, I also led our club stalls during the Orientation Weeks of T1 and T2
										2025, overseeing the secure storage and display of critical and expensive
										electrical IT equipment. I also introduced a Cybersecurity-themed trivia wheel
										and demo of live malware (contained within a VM) to drive engagement and foster
										curiosity among stall visitors. I also designed the club's current tablecloth.
