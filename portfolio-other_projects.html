							<h2>Demonstrating Web Vulnerabilities</h2>
							<p>
								This project explores how vulnerabilities arise in web applications due to design
								oversights and misconfigurations (which are intentionally baked into the source code).
								After,
								these vulnerabilities are discovered through
								the use of static and dynamic analysis tools, namely SonarQube and OWASP ZAP,
								respectively. Finally, defensive and prevention mechanisms are put in place in to
								prevent the vulnerabilities. A simple web application (HTML + Js) was used.

							<h2>SSL Certificate Validity Predictor</h2>
							<p>
								This project uses Machine Learning to predict SSL certificate validity based on
								extracted features, such as the issuer, chosen public key algorithm and size, chosen
								signature algorithm, and associated domains (SAN). The certificates were gathered via
								simple connections to a large list of random websites using Python. The RandomForest
								classifier was trained and evaluated, achieving an accuracy score of 0.978.

							<h2>Pythonic Ping Application</h2>
							<p>
								A custom program in Python is developed to implement the ping operation without using
								any direct pinging functions. The project's barebones nature mainly stems from the
								design and
								combination of different checksums.

							<h2>ARP Poisoning Detector</h2>
							<p>
								A simple Pythonic scripts listens for ARP requests and responses, updating an internal
								table accordingly. When a new MAC entry is detected for an already-known device, the
								detection mechanism sends an ARP request to that device based on its last known IP
								address. If, after some time, the received ARP response contains the last known MAC
								address, then the
								previously received ARP response must have been spoofed.

							<h2>Simple TELNET Hijacker</h2>
							<p>
								This attack first involves an ARP jam, wherein the man-in-the-middle (MITM) machine
								sends its own MAC address as the destination MAC to the target client and server
								machines. The machine is configured to forward received packets meant for another MAC
								address (i.e., peer-to-peer). Next, a script sniffs the traffic, then modifies and
								injects its own payload into the packets. The SEQ and ACK values are processed in a way
								that the target client and server machines expects of a normal TELNET session; i.e.,
								neither realizes that there was a MITM between them all this time.
